## Modules

#### virtual_guest

This module is to provision a VM in SoftLayer and run scripts/commands in the newly provisioned VM.

The following scripts/commands executed in the VM sequentially:
* the script to install software
  * (optional) specified varaibles
  * (optional) specified url for sample application tarball
* the commands to remove temporary public key, if required
* the custom commands

The variables expected in the module:

| Variable  | Default  | Description |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| hostname |  | The hostname of virtual guest |
| domain |  | The domain of virtual guest |
| datacenter |  | The data center where virtual guest is provisoned |
| os_reference_code |  | The operating system code in SoftLayer |
| cores |  | The number of CPU cores |
| memory |  | The memory size in GB |
| disk_size |  | The size of the disk |
| private_network_only | false |  |
| network_speed | 100 | The speed of the network |
| tags |  | Tags to the VM instance |
| ssh_user | root | The user for ssh to the virtual guest |
| ssh_label |  | Name to the SSH Key |
| ssh_notes |  | Notes for the SSH Key |
| public_key |  | public SSH key to use in keypair |
| private_key |  | private SSH key to use in keypair |
| install_script | files/default.sh | The script to install software, used in the module |
| script_variables |  | The variables of the script to install software |
